This project uses ordinary Wi-Fi in a way that replicates the good characteristics of analog radio.
We are transmitting and receiving HD video, telemetry, audio, and control data all in one solution.

As such the display/receiver side also includes a very full featured OSD.
This is also augmented by an optional android app that connects to the system and facilitates settings changes.
